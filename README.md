# Mini-Messaging-Board
Application of MVC model with Express.js, EJS, and JS in the form of a small messaging board.

## Important notice
Project idea failed due to requiring front-end fetching user data from localStorage on web browser which I don't know how to connect to server side as of making this project. This results into every user visiting the site being logged into as the creator (the first user) and not being able to create their own account.
